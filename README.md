## Models & Associations

Notes on associations:
- User has_one mentor / mentee, this has been set to optional (i.e. if a user wanted to only be a mentor or mentee).
- Association of `has_one` has been used, so that a User only has one set of info for them as either a Mentor or Mentee: they cannot have multiple 'profiles' as a Mentee, for example.
- A User may be a mentor to multiple mentees (or be a mentee to multiple users); however as the Mentor and Mentee tables are for the bio / interest / skills data, any given user can only appear once in these tables. The actual mentorship relationships (of which they can have multiple) are held in the Mentorships table.
- See the Wiki for tables & relationships
